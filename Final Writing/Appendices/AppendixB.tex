This repository contains all the Python code used to generate and build the recommender models. It also includes notebooks for the data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, and data exploration. The actual data used in this thesis is not included in the repository due to its size, however, we provide the scripts to load, preprocess and clean the dataset. 

The data used in this thesis is the Amazon Product Reviews dataset. The dataset can be found at the link: \url{https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/}. The dataset is available in multiple categories and can be downloaded in JSON format. We chose to download and use the "5-core" datasets for each category available on the page. Cumulatively (summing up across all categories), there are just over 75 million reviews.
