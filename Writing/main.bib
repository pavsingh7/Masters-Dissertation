	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the estimation of the volatility process in a stochastic volatility model of the following form: dXt=  atdt + σtdWt, where X denotes the log-price and σis a c{\`a}dl{\`a}g semi-martingale. In the spirit of a series of recent works on the estimation of the cumulated volatility, we here focus on the instantaneous volatility for which we study estimators built as finite differences of the power variations of the log-price. We provide central limit theorems with an optimal rate depending on the local behavior of σ. In particular, these theorems yield some confidence intervals for σt.},

We demonstrate that in special cases, realized bipower variation estimates integrated variance in stochastic volatility models, thus providing a model-free and consistent alternative to realized variance. Its robustness property means that if we have a stochastic volatility plus infrequent jumps process, then the difference between realized variance and realized bipower variation estimates the quadratic variation of the jump component. This seems to be the first method that can separate quadratic variation into its continuous and jump components. Various extensions are given, together with proofs of special cases of these results. Detailed mathematical results are reported in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003a).}",

abstract = "This paper studies the estimation problem of the covariance matrices of asset returns in the presence of microstructure noise and asynchronicity between the observations across different assets. Motivated by Malliavin and Mancino (2002, 2009) we propose a new Fourier domain based estimator of multivariate ex-post volatility, which we call the Fourier Realized Kernel (FRK). An advantage of this approach is that no explicit time alignment is required unlike the time domain based methods widely adopted in the existing literature. We derive the large sample properties and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator under some general conditions that allow for both temporal and cross-sectional correlations in the measurement error process. Our results can be viewed as Frequency domain extension of the asymptotic theories for the multivariate realized kernel estimator of Barndorff-Nielsen et al. (2011). We show in extensive simulations that our method outperforms the time domain estimators when two assets with different liquidity are traded asynchronously."

 abstract = {Because of their tractability and their natural interpretations in term of market quantities, Hawkes processes are nowadays widely used in high-frequency finance. However, in practice, the statistical estimation results seem to show that very often, only nearly unstable Hawkes processes are able to fit the data properly. By nearly unstable, we mean that the L1 norm of their kernel is close to unity. We study in this work such processes for which the stability condition is almost violated. Our main result states that after suitable rescaling, they asymptotically behave like integrated Cox–Ingersoll–Ross models. Thus, modeling financial order flows as nearly unstable Hawkes processes may be a good way to reproduce both their high and low frequency stylized facts. We then extend this result to the Hawkes-based price model introduced by Bacry et al. [Quant. Finance 13 (2013) 65–77]. We show that under a similar criticality condition, this process converges to a Heston model. Again, we recover well-known stylized facts of prices, both at the microstructure level and at the macroscopic scale.},

We start by reviewing the definitions and the key concepts in point processes.

We also describe a practical example drawn from social media data - we show how to model retweet cascades using a Hawkes self-exciting process. We presents a design of the memory kernel, and results on estimating parameters and predicting popularity. The code and sample event data are available as an online appendix},

Our approach relies on a modification of (classical) jump-robust estimators of integrated realized covariance to estimate the Fourier coefficients of the covariance trajectory. Using Fourier–Féjer inversion we reconstruct the path of the instantaneous covariance. We prove consistency and a central limit theorem (CLT) and in particular that the asymptotic estimator variance is smaller by a factor 2/3 in comparison to classical local estimators. The procedure is robust enough to allow for an iteration and we can show theoretically and empirically how to estimate the integrated realized covariance of the instantaneous stochastic covariance process. We apply these techniques to robust calibration problems for multivariate modeling in finance, i.e., the selection of a pricing measure by using time series and derivatives’ price information simultaneously."

    abstract = { We present a novel simple microstructure model of financial returns that combines (i) the well-known ARFIMA process applied to tick-by-tick returns, (ii) the bid-ask bounce effect, (iii) the fat tail structure of the distribution of returns and (iv) the non-Poissonian statistics of inter-trade intervals. This model allows us to explain both qualitatively and quantitatively important stylized facts observed in the statistics of both microstructure and macrostructure returns, including the short-ranged correlation of returns, the long-ranged correlations of absolute returns, the microstructure noise and Epps effects. According to the microstructure noise effect, volatility is a decreasing function of the time-scale used to estimate it. The Epps effect states that cross correlations between asset returns are increasing functions of the time-scale at which the returns are estimated. The microstructure noise is explained as the result of the negative return correlations inherent in the definition of the bid-ask bounce component (ii). In the presence of a genuine correlation between the returns of two assets, the Epps effect is due to an average statistical overlap of the momentum of the returns of the two assets defined over a finite time-scale in the presence of the long memory process (i). }

    abstract = { We present two statistical causes for the distortion of correlations on high-frequency financial data. We demonstrate that the asynchrony of trades as well as the decimalization of stock prices has a large impact on the decline of the correlation coefficients towards smaller return intervals (Epps effect). These distortions depend on the properties of the time series and are of purely statistical origin. We are able to present parameter-free compensation methods, which we validate in a model setup. Furthermore, the compensation methods are applied to high-frequency empirical data from the NYSE's TAQ database. A major fraction of the Epps effect can be compensated. The contribution of the presented causes is particularly high for stocks that are traded at low prices. }

It induces a microstructure as well as possibly altering the tail behavior. On small return intervals, the tick-size can distort the calculation of correlations. This especially occurs on small return intervals and thus contributes to the decay of the correlation coefficient towards smaller return intervals (Epps effect). We study this behavior within a model and identify the effect in market data. Furthermore, we present a method to compensate this purely statistical error."

Hawkes processes constitute a particular class of multivariate point processes that has become very popular in empirical high-frequency finance this last decade. After a reminder of the main definitions and properties that characterize Hawkes processes, we review their main empirical applications to address many different problems in high-frequency finance. Because of their great flexibility and versatility, we show that they have been successfully involved in issues as diverse as estimating the volatility at the level of transaction data, estimating the market stability, accounting for systemic risk contagion, devising optimal execution strategies or capturing the dynamics of the full order book. }

	Abstract = {{We propose a dynamic econometric microstructure model of trading, and we investigate how the dynamics of trades and trade composition interact with the evolution of market liquidity, market depth, and order flow. We estimate a bivariate generalized autoregressive intensity process for the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades for 16 actively traded stocks over 15 years of transaction data. Our results show that both informed and uninformed trades are highly persistent, but that the uninformed arrival forecasts respond negatively to past forecasts of the informed intensity. Our estimation generates daily conditional arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades, which we use to construct forecasts of the probability of information-based trade (PIN). These forecasts are used in turn to forecast market liquidity as measured by bid-ask spreads and the price impact of orders. We observe that PINs vary across assets and over time, and most importantly that they are correlated across assets. Our analysis shows that one principal component explains much of the daily variation in PINs and that this systemic liquidity factor may be important for asset pricing. We also find that PINs tend to rise before earnings announcement days and decline afterwards.}},

In this paper the theoretical properties of a class of processes with particular reference to the point spectrum or corresponding covariance density functions are discussed.

These are not distinguishable by methods of data analysis based on these properties.},

	Abstract = {Modelling the behaviour of stock markets has been of major interest in the past century. The market can be treated as a network of many investors reacting in accordance to their group behaviour, as manifested by the index and effected by the flow of external information into the system. Here we devise a model that encapsulates the behaviour of stock markets. The model consists of two terms, demonstrating quantitatively the effect of the individual tendency to follow the group and the effect of the individual reaction to the available information. Using the above factors we were able to explain several key features of the stock market: the high correlations between the individual stocks and the index; the Epps effect; the high fluctuating nature of the market, which is similar to real market behaviour. Furthermore, intricate long term phenomena are also described by this model, such as bursts of synchronized average correlation and the dominance of the index as demonstrated through partial correlation.},

HFT is the natural evolution of a new trading paradigm that is characterized by strategic decisions made in a volume-clock metric. Even if the speed advantage disappears, HFT will evolve to continue exploiting structural weaknesses of low-frequency trading (LFT).LFT practitioners are not defenseless against HFT players, however, and this article offers options that can help them survive and adapt to this new environment.},

	Abstract = {A voluminous literature has emerged for modeling the temporal dependencies in financial market volatility using ARCH and stochastic volatility models. While most of these studies have documented highly significant in-sample parameter estimates and pronounced intertemporal volatility persistence, traditional ex-post forecast evaluation criteria suggest that the models provide seemingly poor volatility forecasts. Contrary to this contention, we show that volatility models produce strikingly accurate interdaily forecasts for the latent volatility factor that would be of interest in most financial applications. New methods for improved ex-post interdaily volatility measurements based on high-frequency intradaily data are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Realized volatility is a nonparametric ex-post estimate of the return variation. The most obvious realized volatility measure is the sum of finely-sampled squared return realizations over a fixed time interval. In a frictionless market the estimate achieves consistency for the underlying quadratic return variation when returns are sampled at increasingly higher frequency. We begin with an account of how and why the procedure works in a simplified setting and then extend the discussion to a more general framework. Along the way we clarify how the realized volatility and quadratic return variation relate to the more commonly applied concept of conditional return variance. We then review a set of related and useful notions of return variation along with practical measurement issues (e.g., discretization error and microstructure noise) before briefly touching on the existing empirical applications.},

It divides roughly into three parts. The first part develops the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods, the foundations of derivatives pricing, and the implementation of several of the most important models used in financial engineering. The next part describes techniques for improving simulation accuracy and efficiency. The final third of the book addresses special topics: estimating price sensitivities, valuing American options, and measuring market risk and credit risk in financial portfolios." "The most important prerequisite is familiarity with the mathematical tools used to specify and analyze continuous time models in finance, in particular the key ideas of stochastic calculus. Prior exposure to the basic principles of option pricing is useful but not essential." "The book is aimed at graduate students in financial engineering, researchers in Monte Carlo simulation, and practitioners implementing models in industry."--Jacket.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the problem of covariance estimation when prices are observed non-synchronously and contaminated by i.i.d. microstructure noise. We derive closed form expressions for the bias and variance of three popular covariance estimators, namely realised covariance, realised covariance plus lead and lag adjustments, and the Hayashi and Yoshida estimator, and present a comprehensive investigation into their properties and relative efficiency. Our main finding is that the ordering of the covariance estimators in terms of efficiency crucially depends on the level of microstructure noise, as well as the level of correlation. In fact, for sufficiently high levels of noise, the standard realised covariance estimator (without any corrections for non-synchronous trading) can be most efficient. We also propose a sparse sampling implementation of the Hayashi and Yoshida estimator, study the robustness of our findings using simulations with stochastic volatility and correlation, and highlight some important practical considerations.},

	Abstract = {The It{\^o}--Stratonovich dilemma is revisited from the perspective of the interpretation of Stratonovich calculus using shot noise. Over the long time scales of the displacement of an observable, the principal issue is how to deal with finite/zero autocorrelation of the stochastic noise. The former (non-zero) noise autocorrelation structure preserves the normal chain rule using a mid-point selection scheme, which is the basis Stratonovich calculus, whereas the instantaneous autocorrelation structure of It{\^o}ʼs approach does not. By considering the finite decay of the noise correlations on time scales very short relative to the overall displacement times of the observable, we suggest a generalization of the integral Taylor expansion criterion of Wong and Zakai (1965 Ann.

Online feature correlations are computed using an unbiased, lossless Fourier estimator. A high-speed maximum likelihood clustering algorithm is then used to find the feature cluster configuration which best explains the structure in the correlation matrix. We conjecture that this feature configuration is a candidate descriptor for the temporal state of the system. Using a simple cluster configuration similarity metric, we are able to enumerate the state space based on prevailing feature configurations. The proposed state representation removes the need for human-driven data pre-processing for state attribute specification, allowing a learning agent to find structure in streaming data, discern changes in the system, enumerate its perceived state space and learn suitable action-selection policies.},

The procedure is not based on the Wiener theorem for the quadratic variation, but on the computation of the Fourier coefficients of the process and therefore it relies on the integration of the time series rather than on its differentiation. The method is fully model free and nonparametric. These features make the method well suited for financial market applications, and in particular for the analysis of high frequency time series and for the computation of cross volatilities.},
