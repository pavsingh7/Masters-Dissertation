# Acknowledgements 

I would like to thank many people who made this journey happy, inspiring and rewarding. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisors Ian Durbach and Allan Clark. Iâ€™ve learned a lot from their deep insights in statistics and their passion about developing scientific and practically useful methodologies.  They were both very generous with their time and are always there to help. I am deeply grateful for all the inspiring discussions we had and the constructive feedbacks I received.
