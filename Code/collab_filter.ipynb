    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: evaluate the performance of our user-based collaborative filtering model by comparing the predicted ratings with the actual ratings provided by users. We split the data into training and testing sets. In the evaluation process of collaborative filtering, we simulate the real-world scenario of making predictions for unseen or unrated items by temporarily hiding some of the user's rated items. These hidden items serve as the testing set, and we use the remaining rated items as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each user:\n",
    "- Identify their rated items.\n",
    "- Randomly split their rated items into two sets: training set and testing set.\n",
    "- The testing set contains some of the rated items (usually a small percentage), which we temporarily hide from the model.\n",
    "- The training set contains the remaining rated items, which the model uses to learn about user preferences and calculate user similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the training set, calculate user similarity and predict ratings for the items in the testing set. We do this by finding similar users and leveraging their ratings to make predictions for the hidden items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare the predicted ratings with the actual ratings in the testing set, which were temporarily hidden. Calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess how well the model is predicting user-item ratings for unseen items.\n",

    "### User-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **change data to user-item matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We shall be converting the original dataframe into a user-item matrix where each row represents a user, each column represents an item (product), and the cell values are the corresponding ratings given by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **calculate similarity between users**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We calculate the similarity between users based on their rating patterns. This is typically done using similarity metrics like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The similarity metric measures how similar two users are in terms of their preferences for items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **predict rating for each user-item pair**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once we have calculated user similarity, we can use this information to predict the missing (unrated) ratings in the user-item matrix. The idea is to find users who are similar to the target user and use their ratings for unrated items to make predictions.\n",
    "- we used a weighted sum of the user's past ratings for similar items to predict the ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **evaluate the performance of the algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to evaluate how well our predicted ratings match the actual ratings provided by users. This is typically done by splitting the data into training and testing sets, making predictions on the test set, and comparing the predicted ratings with the actual ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **recommend items with highest predicted ratings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- By identifying the unrated items with the highest predicted ratings, we can suggest new items to users based on their preferences and the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**: User-based collaborative filtering involves constructing a user-item matrix, calculating user similarity, predicting missing ratings, evaluating the model's performance, and using the model to make personalized item recommendations. "

    "**Summary**: Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems. Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices. The rows of the first matrix represent the users and the columns of the second matrix represent the items. The lower dimensionality is chosen such that the product of the two matrices is equal to the original matrix. The values in the reconstructed matrix are the predicted ratings for the missing values in the original matrix."

    "\n",
    "This piece is an implementation of a neural matrix factorization model for collaborative filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network is trained to learn the user and item embeddings that best reconstruct the observed ratings in the interaction matrix. NMF leverages the power of neural networks to capture non-linear relationships between users and items, enabling better representation of the user and item latent features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I.e., a neural network-based matrix factorization approach**. NMF directly factorizes the user-item interaction matrix, and the latent features are learned by a neural network."
