    "# Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrix Factorization is a general technique used in collaborative filtering and other applications where a matrix is decomposed into the product of two lower-rank matrices.\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used to minimize the error in the factorization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key idea is to iteratively update the elements of the factorized matrices using the gradient of the error with respect to the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems. Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the user-item interaction matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the data**\n",
    "- data is provided in a dataframe where each row is a review\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a user-item matrix**\n",
    "- convert dataframe into user-item matrix where each row is a user and each column is an item\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create test and train set**\n",
    "- hide $N$ ratings for each user in the training set and use them to test the performance of the model\n",
    "- Typically, a certain percentage of ratings for each user are masked in the training set and used for testing the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  Decompose the user-item interaction matrix into two non-negative matrices: a user matrix and an item matrix.\n",
    "    2. Minimize the reconstruction error between the original matrix and the product of the decomposed matrices using optimization techniques like gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Make predictions**\n",
    "- For each user-item pair in the test set, predict the rating by reconstructing the original rating matrix using the decomposed user and item matrices.\n",
    "- The predicted rating is obtained by taking the dot product of the corresponding user and item latent factor vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the model**\n",
    "- Calculate the predictive accuracy of the model using various evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "- Additionally, assess the Top-N recommendation performance of the model using metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit Rate.\n"

    "The implementation of matrix factorization using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Let’s break down the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "- We initialize matrices P and Q with non-negative random values, which is appropriate for NMF.\n",
    "- The bias terms b_u and b_i are initialized to zeros, and the global bias b is calculated as the mean of non-zero elements in the input matrix R.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update Rules:\n",
    "- We use the SGD approach to update P and Q iteratively based on the error eij (difference between the actual rating and the predicted rating).\n",
    "- If use_regularization is enabled, We apply L2 regularization to the updates by adding a penalty term proportional to the current value of P and Q.\n",
    "- The bias terms b_u and b_i are also updated based on the error.\n",
    "- Main Loop: The code runs for a fixed number of iterations, with each iteration looping over all $(i,j)$, entries in the input matrix $R$. If R[i][j] is a non-zero rating, it computes the prediction error $e_{ij}$ (difference between observed and predicted ratings). Then, it updates P[i] and Q[j] by SGD with added regularization terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convergence Check:\n",
    "- We monitor the convergence by calculating the Frobenius norm of the difference between the original matrix R and the reconstructed matrix PQ^T.\n",
    "- If the difference falls below a threshold (0.001 in our case), the algorithm stops iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bias Terms:\n",
    "- We correctly add the bias terms to the final prediction if use_bias is enabled."
