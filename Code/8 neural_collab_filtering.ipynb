    "This piece is a TensorFlow implementation of Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) from the paper [He et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "NCF uses neural networks to model the interactions between users and items. NCF replaces the inner product (used in ordinary MF methods) with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data. This allows NCF to express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. Essentially, it uses a neural network to learn the user-item interaction function, and uses the learned function to predict the corresponding rating. A multi-layer perceptron is used to learn the user-item interaction function. \n"

    "### Top-N Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***Process***\n",
    "\n",
    "***TLDR***: adjust  test setit to only contain items that a user liked (above a threshold). Then use my predictions in completed matrix, to get a list of top-N list of items to recommend to the user. If the user has already rated the item, then I will not recommend it. See how many of the recommended items are in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By adjusting your test set to only include items that meet or exceed a certain threshold (for example, ratings of 4 or above), we can evaluate our model's performance specifically on predicting items that the user likes or interacts with positively\n",
    "-  if an item receives a low rating from a user, it is unlikely to be recommended by your model or to be of interest to the user in the future. Therefore, you can focus your evaluation on how well your model predicts high-quality recommendations, which are more likely to lead to user satisfaction and engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test Set Adjustment: Modify your test set to only include items that the user liked, typically by setting a threshold for ratings (e.g., only items rated 4 or 5).\n",
    "2. Predictions: Generate predictions for each user-item pair using your model. For pairs where a user has not rated an item yet, your model should predict a rating.\n",
    "3. Top Recommendations: Rank the predicted ratings for each user's unrated items and select the top recommendations (e.g., top 100) based on these predicted ratings.\n",
    "4. Avoiding Already Rated Items: Check if the recommended items are already rated by the user (in your modified test set). If an item is already rated, you should not recommend it.\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Assess the performance of your recommender system using metrics like Precision and Recall, which evaluate how well your recommendations align with the user's preferences (as captured by the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ***Metrics***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision@K:**\n",
    "- Precision@K measures the proportion of relevant items among the top-K recommended items.\n",
    "- It answers the question: “Out of the top-K recommendations, how many are actually relevant?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall@K:**\n",
    "- It answers the question: “Out of all relevant items, how many were included in the top-K recommendations?”\n",
    "- Recall@K (also known as Hit Rate@K) measures how well you capture relevant items among all the relevant items.\n"

    "1. Test Set Adjustment: Modify your test set to only include items that the user liked, typically by setting a threshold for ratings (e.g., only items rated 4 or 5).\n",
    "2. Predictions: Generate predictions for each user-item pair using your model. For pairs where a user has not rated an item yet, your model should predict a rating.\n",
    "3. Top Recommendations: Rank the predicted ratings for each user's unrated items and select the top recommendations (e.g., top 100) based on these predicted ratings.\n",
    "4. Avoiding Already Rated Items: Check if the recommended items are already rated by the user (in your modified test set). If an item is already rated, you should not recommend it.\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Assess the performance of your recommender system using metrics like Precision and Recall, which evaluate how well your recommendations align with the user's preferences (as captured by the test set).\n"
