# Topic

**A Hybrid Multi-Modal Recommender System with Neural Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Filtering**

We essentially build a multi-modal recommender system which leverages both a neural collaborative filtering approach  and content based filtering approach. We take the text and ratings data from amazon products reviews data set.  We evaluate our model and compare it to other baseline models such as other Matrix Factorization methods and/or Memory-based methods. Can also compare performance of the model with and without text data incorporated into model. 

Further details on the topic and outline can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Multi-Modal-Neural-Recommender-System-54bd4551421b4ed3a9e3b743e1c845b6).

# Data

The dataset is based on the Amazon Reviews Dataset which is publicly available. We use a subset of the original dataset, found [here](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#amazon_reviews).


# Research Papers

A collection of good research papers featuring state of the art approaches in multi-modal model, hybrid systems and deep learning applications in recommender systems - found [here](https://github.com/pavsingh7/Masters-Dissertation/tree/main/Papers%20and%20Resources).
