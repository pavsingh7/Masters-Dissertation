# Topic

**A Multi-Modal Hybrid Neural Collaborative Recommender System**

We essentially build a multi-modal neural collaborative filtering recommender system. We take the text and ratings data from amazon reviews data set.  Evaluate our model and compare it to other baseline models such as Matrix Factorisation methods and Memory-based methods. Can also compare performance of the model with and without text data incorporated into model. 

Further details  on the topic and outline can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Multi-Modal-Neural-Recommender-System-54bd4551421b4ed3a9e3b743e1c845b6).
